# ListMovies
Project created for the ArcTouch interview of the xamarim developer position

There are no special instructions for building;

The first time you use the application click on the edit button and enter a number such as "1313" for the application to search the movies for this list of favorite movies, if you want to know the favorite movies from other lists, enter a different value;


List of third-party libraries:

1 - Arc.User.Dialogs: Used to inform the user that the application is searching for the desired information and it is necessary to wait. This same library is used to display alerts on Xamarin.Forms;

2 - Microsoft.Net.Http: Used to simplify communication between the api and the application through the Http protocol;

3 - Newtonsoft.Json: Used to parse the server response for a given object;

4 - Realm: Used to save movie information locally;

5 - Xam.Plugin.Connectivity: Used to check the connection of the device to the network, important for decision making if you do not have an internet connection;
